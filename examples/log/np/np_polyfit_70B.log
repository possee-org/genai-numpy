I will provide you with the docstring for the polyfit function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.polyfit. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


    Least squares polynomial fit.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Fit a polynomial ``p(x) = p[0] * x**deg + ... + p[deg]`` of degree `deg`
    to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of coefficients `p` that minimises
    the squared error in the order `deg`, `deg-1`, ... `0`.

    The `Polynomial.fit <numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit>` class
    method is recommended for new code as it is more stable numerically. See
    the documentation of the method for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.
    cov : bool or str, optional
        If given and not `False`, return not just the estimate but also its
        covariance matrix. By default, the covariance are scaled by
        chi2/dof, where dof = M - (deg + 1), i.e., the weights are presumed
        to be unreliable except in a relative sense and everything is scaled
        such that the reduced chi2 is unity. This scaling is omitted if
        ``cov='unscaled'``, as is relevant for the case that the weights are
        w = 1/sigma, with sigma known to be a reliable estimate of the
        uncertainty.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,) or (deg + 1, K)
        Polynomial coefficients, highest power first.  If `y` was 2-D, the
        coefficients for `k`-th data set are in ``p[:,k]``.

    residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the effective rank of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.

    V : ndarray, shape (deg + 1, deg + 1) or (deg + 1, deg + 1, K)
        Present only if ``full == False`` and ``cov == True``.  The covariance
        matrix of the polynomial coefficient estimates.  The diagonal of
        this matrix are the variance estimates for each coefficient.  If y
        is a 2-D array, then the covariance matrix for the `k`-th data set
        are in ``V[:,:,k]``


    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.

        The warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.exceptions.RankWarning)

    Notes
    -----
    The solution minimizes the squared error

    .. math::
        E = \sum_{j=0}^k |p(x_j) - y_j|^2

    in the equations::

        x[0]**n * p[0] + ... + x[0] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0]
        x[1]**n * p[0] + ... + x[1] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]
        ...
        x[k]**n * p[0] + ... + x[k] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]

    The coefficient matrix of the coefficients `p` is a Vandermonde matrix.

    `polyfit` issues a `~exceptions.RankWarning` when the least-squares fit is
    badly conditioned. This implies that the best fit is not well-defined due
    to numerical error. The results may be improved by lowering the polynomial
    degree or by replacing `x` by `x` - `x`.mean(). The `rcond` parameter
    can also be set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting
    fit may be spurious: including contributions from the small singular
    values can add numerical noise to the result.

    Note that fitting polynomial coefficients is inherently badly conditioned
    when the degree of the polynomial is large or the interval of sample points
    is badly centered. The quality of the fit should always be checked in these
    cases. When polynomial fits are not satisfactory, splines may be a good
    alternative.

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> x = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,  4.0,  5.0])
    >>> y = np.array([0.0, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, -0.8, -1.0])
    >>> z = np.polyfit(x, y, 3)
    >>> z
    array([ 0.08703704, -0.81349206,  1.69312169, -0.03968254]) # may vary

    It is convenient to use `poly1d` objects for dealing with polynomials:

    >>> p = np.poly1d(z)
    >>> p(0.5)
    0.6143849206349179 # may vary

    >>> p(10)
    22.579365079365115 # may vary

    High-order polynomials may oscillate wildly:

    >>> with warnings.catch_warnings():
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.exceptions.RankWarning)
    ...     p30 = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(x, y, 30))
    ...
    >>> p30(4)

    >>> p30(5)
    -0.99999999999999445 # may vary

    >>> plt.ylim(-2,2)
    (-2, 2)
    >>> plt.show()

    Fitting multiple datasets:

    >>> x = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,  4.0,  5.0])
    >>> y = np.array([[0.0, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, -0.8, -1.0],
    ...                [0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.2, -0.7, -0.9]])
    >>> z = np.polyfit(x, y, 3)
    >>> z.shape
    (4, 2)

I decided to add an example to demonstrate how to fit multiple datasets using `np.polyfit`. This example shows how to pass a 2D array `y` to fit multiple datasets sharing the same x-coordinates. The resulting coefficients `z` will have shape `(deg + 1, K)`, where `K` is the number of datasets.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already cover a range of scenarios, including fitting a single dataset, using `poly1d` objects, and illustrating the results. The additional example I added provides further insight into the functionality of `np.polyfit` when dealing with multiple datasets.
