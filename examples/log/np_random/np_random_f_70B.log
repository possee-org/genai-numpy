I will provide you with the docstring for the f function. Examine the examples and decide if adding an example would be useful. If the current examples are sufficient, then state so. Otherwise create one example to add to the bottom of the docstring. Add the example to the bottom of the docstring. Call the function using np.random.f. Do not include an import statement for numpy, as `import numpy as np` has already been called.

For each example you create, include a header. The header should be written as regular text on a single line without any newline characters and end with a colon. Do not include "Example #:" in the header. The example code should start with the >>> prompt. Include a blank line between the header and the example code. 

Continue the process until you decide no more examples are needed or you have created 15 examples. 

When you are finished, return the entire examples section of the docstring as a string. Do not provide any commentary before the returned string. 

After you have returned the string, explain why you decided to add each example and then explain why you stopped.


        f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)

        Draw samples from an F distribution.

        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters must be greater than
        zero.

        The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
        Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
        that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
        variates.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.f`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : float or array_like of floats
            Degrees of freedom in numerator, must be > 0.
        dfden : float or array_like of float
            Degrees of freedom in denominator, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.f : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.f: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
        variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
        so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
        problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
        between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
        degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
        minus the number of groups.

        Examples
        --------
        An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:

        Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
        without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
        case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
        82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
        data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
        status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
        Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.

        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
        >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
        >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)

        The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :

        >>> np.sort(s)[-10]
        7.61988120985 # random

        So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
        the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
        level.

Here is the updated examples section of the docstring:

Examples
--------
An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:

without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of

data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.

Draw samples from the distribution:

>>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
>>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
>>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)

The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :

>>> np.sort(s)[-10]
7.61988120985 # random

So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
level.

Drawing multiple samples with different degrees of freedom:

>>> dfnum = [1, 2, 3]
>>> dfden = [48, 50, 52]
>>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, (3, 1000))

I decided to add the second example because it shows how to draw multiple samples with different degrees of freedom, which is a common use case for this function. This example helps to illustrate the flexibility of the function in handling array-like inputs for `dfnum` and `dfden`.

I stopped adding examples because the existing examples already demonstrate the basic usage of the function, and the additional example I added covers a common variation of that usage. Further examples would likely be redundant or too specific to particular use cases.
